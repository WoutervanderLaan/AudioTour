# Source Directory (`src`)

This directory contains the core source files for the project. It is structured into multiple subfolders, each responsible for a specific part of the application's functionality:

## Subdirectories

- **[app](./app)**: This folder contains application-level configuration and initialization files, including navigation, entry points, and app setup.
- **[features](./features)**: A collection of self-contained modules representing specific features or functionalities of the app.
- **[shared](./shared)**: Shared utilities, components, and resources that are reused across the application.
- **[store](./store)**: Contains files related to global state management, including slices, middleware, and other Redux-based logic.
- **[themes](./themes)**: Manages styles, tokens, and theming configurations for the app.

## Additional Files

- `types.d.ts`: TypeScript definitions used throughout the source files.

Be sure to include documentation for new subdirectories as the project evolves.
