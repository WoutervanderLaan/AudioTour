# src/shared/lib/utils

General utility functions and helpers.

## Purpose

Contains reusable utility functions that are generic and not tied to specific features. Examples include:

- String manipulation helpers
- Date/time formatting
- Data transformation utilities
- Common helper functions

These utilities should be pure functions when possible and have no dependencies on app state or features.
