# src/shared/hooks

Shared custom React hooks.

## Purpose

Contains reusable React hooks that are generic and can be used across multiple features. Examples include:

- Common UI interaction hooks
- Data fetching hooks
- State management hooks
- Lifecycle hooks

These hooks should be generic and not tied to specific business logic or features.
