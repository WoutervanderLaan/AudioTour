# src/shared/components/features

Complex reusable feature components.

## Features

- **[audio-player/](./audio-player)** - Audio playback component with controls
- **[progress-indicator/](./progress-indicator)** - Progress indicator component for multi-step flows

## Purpose

Contains complex, self-contained UI features that are reusable across the app but are more sophisticated than simple UI components. These components:

- May have internal state management
- Provide complete functionality (not just presentation)
- Are still generic (not tied to specific business features)
