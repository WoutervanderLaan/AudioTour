# src/shared/types

Global TypeScript type definitions.

## Purpose

Contains TypeScript types, interfaces, and type utilities that are used across multiple parts of the application. This includes:

- Shared data model types
- API response types
- Common utility types
- Type helpers and transformations

Types specific to a feature should be in that feature's `types/` folder instead.
