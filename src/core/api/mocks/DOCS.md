# src/core/api/mocks

Mock data and fixtures for API mocking during development and testing.

## Purpose

This directory is reserved for mock data, fixtures, and response templates used by the MSW (Mock Service Worker) handlers defined in the `mock-config/` directory. Currently empty as mock data is being defined inline in handlers, but this folder serves as the designated location for extracting mock data into reusable fixtures as the mocking needs grow.
