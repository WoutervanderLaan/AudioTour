# src/store/middleware

Zustand store middleware.

## Purpose

Contains middleware functions that enhance the Zustand store with additional capabilities such as:

- State persistence
- Logging and debugging
- DevTools integration
- State synchronization

Middleware wraps the store to add cross-cutting concerns without modifying individual slices.
